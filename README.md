Repository including bug reports for Sizeer mobile app.
I created three bug reports for Sizeer mobile app. 
The first bug report is about "Failure of the sort feature". 
The second bug report is about " crash of the app - critical error".
The last bug report is about "Error in the list of stores in Poland".
Each bug report is in the template. 
Bug reports were created in 2021. 
Bug templates are from one of the crowdtesting companies. 
Bug reports were approved by the leader of the testing project.
